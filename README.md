# HateDetect
##A project investigating methods of improving hate speech detection methods for social media platforms.

#### NB: As part of this package, some unit tests and string conversion methods require the usage of harmful and hateful language. This is only done to try and advance hate speech modelling and detection, with the goal of reducing the impact of hate online.
#### As part of this project, files which contain hateful words or terms are marked with `_LW_` as part of the title, and contain a forward indicating the presence of hateful language.

#### Files beginning with `LW_` (or `test_LW_` in the case of pytest files) contain hateful slurs and terms.
